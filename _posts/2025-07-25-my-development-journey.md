# My Software Engineering Journey: From Student to Developer

Every developer has a story — this is mine. From late-night study sessions in college to debugging personal projects at 2 AM, the path hasn’t been easy, but it’s been rewarding. I’m sharing my journey not just as a reflection, but maybe as a spark for someone else walking a similar path.

## 🎓 College: Where It All Started

College gave me the foundation — not just in code, but in thinking like an engineer. Here’s what shaped me most:

- **Core CS Courses**: Algorithms, databases, networking — the hard stuff that teaches you how computers *really* work.
- **Hands-on Projects**: From group web apps to solo CLI tools, every build made me better.
- **Balancing Act**: Learning to juggle deadlines, job hunting, and caffeine consumption was a skill in itself.

It wasn’t just about memorizing syntax. It was about understanding how systems interact and how to solve real problems with tech.

## 💻 Projects That Pushed Me

Here are a few projects that really helped me grow outside the classroom:

### 🏠 Roommate Management App
Built with Node.js, SQLite, and EJS — this app tracked schedules, chores, and common courtesy rules. It taught me more about clean architecture and user-centered design than any textbook.

### 💰 Personal Finance Tracker
A full-stack web app to manage income, recurring expenses, and savings goals. I integrated charts, reminders, and session tracking. This was my deep dive into UX and backend data flow.

### 🎮 Game Development in Unity
Creating small 2D systems taught me more about object-oriented programming, animation states, and performance than any class lecture. It was equal parts frustrating and satisfying.

## 📚 What I’ve Learned

Some key lessons I’ll carry forever:
- **Start scrappy.** Every polished product began as a messy draft.
- **Read the docs.** Seriously, they’re lifesavers.
- **Ask questions.** StackOverflow and ChatGPT became my best friends.
- **Never stop iterating.** Whether it’s UI, logic, or life — everything improves with feedback.

## 🛠️ Current Focus

Right now, I’m continuing to build. I’m improving existing projects, exploring new frameworks, and learning better ways to work with databases, APIs, and frontends.
