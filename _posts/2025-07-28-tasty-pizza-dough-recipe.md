This is my go-to pizza dough recipe — quick, reliable, and honestly better than most store-bought options. It comes together in under 30 minutes and is perfect for weeknights when I want something simple but satisfying. I make this dough regularly and have tweaked it just slightly over time.

I use a classic combination of flour, warm water, and yeast, but I swap out half of the sugar for honey. It gives the dough a nice depth of flavor and helps it brown up beautifully.

## 🍕 Ingredients

- **2 cups all-purpose flour** (plus more for kneading)
- **2¼ teaspoons instant yeast** (or one yeast packet)

## 🧑‍🍳 Instructions

### 1. Combine the dry ingredients
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.

### 2. Mix in the wet ingredients
Add the warm water, honey, and oil to the bowl. Stir until the dough starts to come together.

### 3. Knead the dough
Transfer the dough to a floured surface. Knead for 3–4 minutes until smooth and elastic. If it’s too sticky, sprinkle in a bit more flour a tablespoon at a time.

### 4. Let it rest
Cover the dough and let it sit for 10 minutes. This helps the gluten relax and makes it easier to shape.

### 5. Shape your crust
Roll or stretch the dough into a 10–12 inch circle, depending on how thick you want the crust.

### 6. Add toppings
Sauce, cheese, and whatever else you're craving — it’s your pizza, make it your way.

### 7. Bake it hot
Preheat your oven to **425°F**. Bake for 12–15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.
